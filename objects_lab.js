// # Object Exercises
//
// ## Question 1
//
// Given the cat object below:
//
// ```js
 let cat = {
   genus: 'Felis',
   species: 'Catus'
}
// ```
//
// a. Log the species of `cat`.

console.log(cat.species)
//
// b. Add a new key 'color' and give it a value.
cat.color = 'black'
console.log(cat)

// c. Write code that logs whether or not `cat` has the property 'texture'.
console.log(cat.texture)

// ## Question 2
//
// What will the code below log?  Explain why.
//
// ```js
let p1 = {
  name: 'Joe'
}

let p2 = {
  name: 'Joe'
}

console.log(p1 === p2)

// the code above  will  log false
// For any variable of the object type,
// the quality operator === will only return true if
// both sides refer to the exact same object.
// It's not enough for them to just look the same.

// ```
//
// ## Question 3
//
// Given the object variable `spanishNumbers` below:
//
// ```js
let spanishNumbers = {1: "uno", 2: "dos", 3: "tres", 4: "quatro", 5: "cinco"}

// ```
//
// Write a code block that takes an object variable and stores
// the *keys* in an array.  Then log the array.
let spanishNumbers1 = [];
for(let key in spanishNumbers) {
  spanishNumbers1.push(key)
}
console.log(spanishNumbers1)

// b. Write a code block that takes an object variable and
// stores the *values* in an array.  Then log the array.
//
let spanishNumbers2 = []
for (let key in spanishNumbers) {
  spanishNumbers2.push(spanishNumbers[key])
}
console.log(spanishNumbers2)
//
// ## Question 4
//
// Write a code block the logs the number of properties an object has.



//
// ## Question 5
//
// Loop through the following object and log all of the directors.
//
// ``` js
let films = [
 {
   name: 'Psycho',
   director: 'Alfred Hitchcock',
   released: 1960
 }, {
   name: 'Citizen Kane',
   director: 'Orson Welles',
   released: 1941
 }, {
   name: 'The Usual Suspects',
   director: 'Bryan Singer',
   released: 1995
 }
]

for (let i = 0; i < films.length; i++) {
  let currentFilms =  films[i]
  let director = films[i].director
    console.log(director)
}
//
// }

// //logs 'Alfred Hitchcock', 'Orson Welles', 'Bryan Singer'
// ```
//
//
// ## Question 6
//
// You are given an array of objects. Each object in the array contains
// exactly 2 keys `“firstName”` and `“lastName”`
//
// ```js
let people = [
    {
        "firstName": "Calvin",
        "lastName": "Newton"
    },
    {
        "firstName": "Garry",
        "lastName": "Mckenzie"
    },
    {
        "firstName": "Leah",
        "lastName": "Rivera"
    },
    {
        "firstName": "Sonja",
        "lastName": "Moreno"
    },
    {
        "firstName": "Noel",
        "lastName": "Bowen"
    }
]
// ```
// a. Create an array of strings called `firstNames` that contains
//only the values for `“firstName”` from each object.

let firstNames = []
for (let i = 0; i < people.length; i++) {
firstNames.push(people[i].firstName)
}
console.log(firstNames)

// b. Create an array of strings called `fullNames`
// that contains the values for `“firstName”` and `“lastName”`
// from the object separated by a space.
//
let fullNames = []
for (let i = 0; i < people.length; i++) {
fullNames.push(people[i].firstName + " " + people[i].lastName)
}
console.log(fullNames)
//
// ## Question 7
//
// Print the second most common letter in the string below:
//
// var myString = "We're flooding people with information. We need to feed it through a processor. A human must turn information into intelligence or knowledge. We've tended to forget that no computer will ever ask a new question."
//
// ## Question 8
//
// You are given the object `deposits`, which maps a persons name to an
//array of deposits that have been made to their account.
//
// a) Write code to to print the name and total amount deposited of the
//person who received the most money.

// let deposits = {
//  "Williams" : [300.65, 270.45, 24.70, 52.00, 99.99],
//  "Cooper" : [200.56, 55.00, 600.78, 305.15, 410.76, 35.00],
//  "Davies" : [400.98, 56.98, 300.00],
//  "Clark" : [555.23, 45.67, 99.95, 80.76, 56.99, 46.50, 265.70],
//  "Johnson" : [12.56, 300.00, 640.50, 255.60, 26.88]
// }


// ```js
// let firstArr = [1,2,3]
// let secondArr = [1,5,2,4]
//
// // log [1,5,2,4]
// ```

// b) Create an array called `stolenCents`, iterate over deposits for each
// person and steal their cents! ... like Office Space or Superman 3.
// Calculate the decimal part of each value, add it to the `stolenCents`
// array and round down the value in the original object.
//
// c) How much money did you steal?
//
// ```js
// let deposits = {
//  "Williams" : [300.65, 270.45, 24.70, 52.00, 99.99],
//  "Cooper" : [200.56, 55.00, 600.78, 305.15, 410.76, 35.00],
//  "Davies" : [400.98, 56.98, 300.00],
//  "Clark" : [555.23, 45.67, 99.95, 80.76, 56.99, 46.50, 265.70],
//  "Johnson" : [12.56, 300.00, 640.50, 255.60, 26.88]
// }
// ```
//
// ## Question 9
//
// * Create an object to hold information on your favorite recipe.
//It should have the following properties: `name`, `servings`, and
//`ingredients` (an array).
// * Create a loop that logs the recipe information, so it looks like:
//
// ```javascript
// name: Mole
// servings: 2
// ingredients: cinnamon, cumin, cocoa
// ```
let favoriteRecipe = {
  name : 'macaroni salad',
  servings: 16,
  ingredients: ['fusilli','cherry tomatoes', 'provolone cheese', 'salami', 'pepperoni', 'bell pepper', 'black olives', 'italian dressing']
}
console.log(favoriteRecipe)
//
// for (let i = 0; i < favoriteRecipe.length; i++) {
//   let currentRecipe =  favoriteRecipe
//   let ingredients = favoriteRecipe.ingredients
//   console.log(ingredients)
// }


//
// ## Question 10
// * Create an array of films, where each film has the following properties: title, director, and a boolean indicating if you started watching it.
// * Create a code block that iterates over the array and logs whether the film was watched or not. Examples:
//
// `You already watched "Wonder Woman" directed by Patty Jenkins`
// `You still need to watch "Wonder Woman" by director Patty Jenkins. `
//
//
// ## Question 11
//
// Given the following exert from the Declaration of Independence, find the most frequent word that is longer than 5 characters.
//
// ```js
// const declarationOfIndependence = `
// When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the
// political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the
// earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle
// them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes
// which impel them to the separation.
//
// We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by
// their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit
// of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving
// their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government
// becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to
// institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in
// such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence,
// indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and
// transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to
// suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they
// are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same
// Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty,
// to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. Such has
// been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains
// them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great
// Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the
// establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a
// candid world.
// `
